# Data-Analysis-Fitness-Facilities-in-UK

Analyzed correlation between number of fitness facilities (generally on rise from 2008-2018) and turnover for fitness facilities (also generally on rise from 2008-2018).

Followed Cairo's principles while Visualizing Data:
* Truthfulness - Design reflects accurate numbers from the source in correct proportions, it also looks at a large enough period of time to not create impressions from sections of data
* Functionality - Design has tried to optimize data ink ratio and is friendly for all people regardless of limitations of color vision
* Beauty - design conveys only and exactly the answer to the proposed question. It reduces distraction and ambiguity.
* Insightfulness - Design gives view into the correlation and how it has panned out over the 11 years being evaluated

**Result of Analysis** - The visual shows the growth in the two parameters being evaluated from 2008 to 2018. The second graph shows the correlation between the two parameters - number and turnover of fitness facilities in UK. From the 1st visual, you can see how the growth is not necessarily together, there have been some years where the number has grown but turnover remained constant and vice versa. However, there is a significant correlation, over the 11 years, the correlation coefficient comes out to 0.89.
